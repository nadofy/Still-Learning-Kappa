Soooo I have been learning Ruby!
I have created a program where you can input a number and it tells you if your number and if it is bigger, smaller or equal 5!
Here is the code:

puts "Pick an integer! "
user_num = Integer(gets.chomp)

if user_num < 5
  print "You picked a number which is less than 5! You picked #{user_num} " 
elsif user_num > 5
  print "You picked a number bigger than 5! You picked: #{user_num} "
else
  print "You picked a number equal to 5!"
end  

Enjoy!
